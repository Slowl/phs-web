# Pornhub Source - PHS

It's a website / PWA that helps you download Pornhub (community /certified <img src="https://hedik.fr/imgs/phs/certified.png" width="3%">) videos when you can't simply "long press" / "right click" on the video.

# Why ? - The story behind this masterchief

  Bored, I recieve a WhatsApp message from my friend with a link asking me :
  
   - Friend : "Oyy brother, can you download this Pornhub Video ?? I can't ... "
    
   So, I open the pornhub tab, and try to download it ... I can't
    
   - Me : "Hey, that's weird, I can't ... But on some videos I still can"
    
   We start to investigate the issue, until we conclude that we can't when this nasty $ appears under the video most of the time

   - Me : "No worries brother, I got you. Give me 2 or 3 days"

   And that's how the project started
